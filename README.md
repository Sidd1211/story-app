Story App
A simple React-based web application where users can upload and view images as stories. Users can upload their stories, navigate between them, and view each story in a modal with a progress bar indicating the time left for each story. The application also supports scrolling through uploaded stories horizontally.

Features
Upload Stories: Users can upload images that will be displayed as stories.
Story Progress: Each story has a progress bar that fills up over 3 seconds.
Navigate Through Stories: Users can navigate through stories using next and previous buttons.
Responsive Design: The modal displaying the stories adapts to the screen size, ensuring a smooth viewing experience.
Background Blur: When viewing a story, the background is blurred to focus on the current story.
Scrollable Story List: The list of stories is horizontally scrollable if there are more stories than can fit on the screen.
Technologies Used
React: For building the interactive UI components.
CSS: For styling the components and layout.
FileReader API: To handle image file uploads and render them as base64 images.
