# Story App

A simple React-based web application where users can upload and view images as stories. Users can upload their stories, navigate between them, and view each story in a modal with a progress bar indicating the time left for each story. The application also supports scrolling through uploaded stories horizontally.

## Features

- **Upload Stories**: Users can upload images that will be displayed as stories.
- **Story Progress**: Each story has a progress bar that fills up over 3 seconds.
- **Navigate Through Stories**: Users can navigate through stories using next and previous buttons.
- **Responsive Design**: The modal displaying the stories adapts to the screen size, ensuring a smooth viewing experience.
- **Background Blur**: When viewing a story, the background is blurred to focus on the current story.
- **Scrollable Story List**: The list of stories is horizontally scrollable if there are more stories than can fit on the screen.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the interactive UI components.
- **CSS**: For styling the components and layout.
- **FileReader API**: To handle image file uploads and render them as base64 images.
